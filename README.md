COMP532 Group Assignment 2 - Python Cartpole DQN agent 

In this assignment we aimed to design and implement a deep RL 
agent for a video game using OpenAI Gym, an open source interface
to reinforcement learning tasks.

The game of choice was Cartpole, where an agent had to learn 
to balance a pole on top of a cart running on frictionless tracks.
